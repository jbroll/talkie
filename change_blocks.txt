Change Block Format Instructions

When suggesting changes to the code, please follow these guidelines:

 Block markers indicate the start of each block:
 - They have the form "# @block_name"

 The HEADER block is special:
 - It contains content that always appears at the top of the file.
 - It is not explicitly labeled in the file.
 - It cannot be updated using a change block.
 - Any content before the first block marker is considered part of the HEADER.

 Only include blocks that you are adding or modifying in your change suggestion.
 - Do not include blocks that remain unchanged.
 - Do not use placeholders or comments like "# No changes" for unchanged blocks, doing to will efectivly delete the content of that block.

 When adding or modifying a block, provide the complete content for that block.

 To specify a new order for blocks, use the ORDER block:
 # @ORDER
 block1
 block2
 block3

 The ORDER block should list ALL blocks in the desired order, including unchanged blocks.
 - This provides a complete overview of the file structure.
 - Blocks listed in ORDER but not included in the changes will retain their current content and position.

 New blocks will be added at the end of the file unless an ORDER block is specified.

 When moving blocks using an ORDER block, there is no need to include the complete block content in the changes unless you're also modifying the content.

. ALL of the change blocks should be in a single artifact in the response.

. For existing code that lacks proper block segmentation:
  - Suggest appropriate block names for logical sections of the code.
  - Use these new block names in the ORDER block to reorganize the code.
  - You don't need to repeat the content of these newly named blocks unless you're modifying them.

. If you're unsure about the existing structure or have any questions, ask for clarification before suggesting changes.

Example:

# @imports
import new_module

# @main_function
def main():
    print("This is the main function")

# @helper_functions
def helper1():
    pass

def helper2():
    pass

# @ORDER
imports
main_function
helper_functions

Remember: Only include the blocks you're changing or adding, and use the ORDER block to specify the complete file structure.
