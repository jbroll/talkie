Change Block Format Instructions:

When suggesting changes to the code, please format your response as follows:

1. Use block markers to indicate the start of each block:
   - For functions: Use "def function_name(parameters):"
   - For other blocks: Use "# @block_name"

2. The HEADER block is special:
   - It contains content that always appears at the top of the file.
   - It is not explicitly labeled in the file.
   - It cannot be updated using a change block.
   - Any content before the first block marker or function definition is considered part of the HEADER.

3. To specify a new order for blocks, use the ORDER block:
   # @ORDER
   block1
   block2
   block3

4. Provide the complete content for each block you're changing or adding.

5. Blocks not mentioned will retain their current content and position unless reordered by an ORDER block.

6. New blocks will be added at the start of the file (after the HEADER) unless an ORDER block is specified.

7. When just moving blocks using an ORDER block, there is not need to include the complete block content in the changes.

8. ALL of the change blocks should be in a single artifact in the response

Example:

def new_function():
    print("This is a new function")

def existing_function():
    # This is a modification to an existing function
    print("Modified existing function")

# @ORDER
new_function
existing_function
