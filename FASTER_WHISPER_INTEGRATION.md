# Faster-Whisper Integration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated faster-whisper into Talkie using a coprocess architecture. The system now supports three speech engines with seamless switching.

## Architecture

### Hybrid Engine System (`engine.tcl`)
The engine abstraction layer now supports two engine types:

1. **critcl engines** (in-process)
   - Vosk: Streaming recognition with partial results
   - Sherpa-ONNX: Neural transducer model

2. **coprocess engines** (out-of-process)
   - Faster-Whisper: Batch transcription with CTranslate2 backend

### Engine Registry
Centralized configuration in `engine.tcl`:
```tcl
array set engine_registry {
    vosk,command      "python3 engines/vosk_engine.py"
    vosk,type         "critcl"
    vosk,model_dir    "vosk"

    faster-whisper,command      "engines/faster_whisper_wrapper.sh"
    faster-whisper,type         "coprocess"
    faster-whisper,model_dir    "faster-whisper"
}
```

## Components

### 1. Coprocess Manager (`coprocess.tcl`)
- Manages stdin/stdout communication with speech engine subprocesses
- Handles binary audio data transmission safely
- Provides high-level API: `process`, `final`, `reset`, `model`

### 2. Faster-Whisper Engine (`engines/faster_whisper_engine.py`)
- Python wrapper implementing the coprocess protocol
- Accumulates audio in buffer for batch transcription
- Returns Vosk-compatible JSON responses

**Protocol:**
```
Commands (stdin):
  PROCESS byte_count        - Accumulate audio chunk
  [binary PCM data]
  FINAL                     - Transcribe buffer and clear
  RESET                     - Clear buffer
  MODEL /path               - Load different model

Responses (stdout - JSON):
  {"partial": ""}                                         - Processing
  {"alternatives": [{"text": "...", "confidence": 0.95}]} - Final
  {"status": "ok"}                                        - Success
  {"error": "message"}                                    - Error
```

### 3. Engine Abstraction (`engine.tcl`)
- Unified interface for both engine types
- Automatic branching based on engine type
- Creates recognizer command wrapper for coprocess engines
- No changes required to `audio.tcl`

## Integration Strategy

### VAD-Driven Batch Processing
Talkie's existing Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system provides natural speech segment boundaries:

1. Audio stream continuously processed
2. VAD detects speech start (energy threshold exceeded)
3. Audio accumulated in buffer (with lookback)
4. VAD detects speech end (silence threshold)
5. Complete segment sent to faster-whisper via `FINAL`
6. Transcription returned and displayed

This hybrid approach combines:
- Real-time VAD (Talkie's strength)
- Batch accuracy (Faster-Whisper's strength)

## Files Created

### Core Components
- `src/coprocess.tcl` - IPC manager (103 lines)
- `src/engines/faster_whisper_engine.py` - Python engine (254 lines)
- `src/engines/faster_whisper_wrapper.sh` - Venv launcher

### Modified Files
- `src/engine.tcl` - Hybrid engine abstraction (208 lines)
- `src/talkie.tcl` - Dynamic engine loading
- `src/ui-layout.tcl` - Added faster-whisper to engine list

### Test Suite
- `src/test_engine_switching.tcl` - Engine type switching
- `src/test_all_engines.sh` - Comprehensive integration test
- `src/test_coprocess.tcl` - Protocol testing
- `src/test_audio_engine.py` - Real audio file testing

## Testing Results

### Engine Switching Test
```
✓ Vosk (critcl) engine initializes successfully
✓ Faster-whisper (coprocess) engine initializes successfully
✓ Switching back to Vosk works seamlessly
```

### Full Integration Test
```
Testing: vosk
  Using in-process vosk engine (critcl bindings)
  ✓ Vosk model loaded
  ✓ Talkie Tcl Edition

Testing: faster-whisper
  Starting faster-whisper coprocess engine...
  Engine started successfully:
  Engine: faster-whisper
  ✓ Talkie Tcl Edition

Testing: vosk (switch back)
  Using in-process vosk engine (critcl bindings)
  ✓ Vosk model loaded
  ✓ Talkie Tcl Edition
```

## Usage

### Configuration
Select engine via GUI config dialog or edit `~/.talkie.conf`:
```json
{
  "speech_engine": "faster-whisper"
}
```

### Model Setup
Models stored in `/home/john/src/talkie/models/faster-whisper/`

Faster-whisper will download models on first use to:
- `/home/john/src/talkie/models/faster-whisper/.cache/`

### Switching Engines
1. Open Config dialog
2. Select "Speech Engine" dropdown
3. Choose: vosk, sherpa, or faster-whisper
4. Apply (no restart needed - change takes effect on next transcription start)

## Benefits

### Architecture
- **Isolation**: Engine crashes don't affect Talkie
- **No Library Conflicts**: Each engine runs in its own process
- **Language Agnostic**: Can add engines in any language
- **Clean Interface**: All engines use same recognizer API

### Performance
- **Accuracy**: Faster-Whisper provides state-of-the-art transcription
- **Speed**: CTranslate2 backend optimized for inference
- **Latency**: VAD-driven segmentation provides near-real-time feel
- **Resource Usage**: CPU-only mode with int8 quantization

## Technical Details

### Sample Rate Handling
- Coprocess manager converts float sample rates to integers
- Python engine handles both int and float strings: `int(float(sample_rate))`

### Binary I/O Safety
- All stdin operations use `sys.stdin.buffer` (binary mode)
- Command lines read as binary, then decoded to UTF-8
- Audio data read directly as binary
- Prevents mixing binary/text modes that caused `UnicodeDecodeError`

### Vosk Compatibility
- Faster-whisper returns responses in Vosk JSON format
- `audio.tcl` requires no changes
- Seamless switching between engines at runtime

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. GPU acceleration (CUDA support)
2. Additional models (multilingual, specialized domains)
3. Streaming whisper variants
4. Custom VAD tuning per engine
5. Confidence-based model selection

### Other Coprocess Engines
The coprocess architecture makes it trivial to add:
- Google Cloud Speech
- Azure Speech Services
- AWS Transcribe
- Custom models via Hugging Face Transformers
