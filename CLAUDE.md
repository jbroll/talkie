# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Talkie is a speech-to-text program designed for Ubuntu Linux that provides seamless audio integration. It captures audio input, performs speech-to-text transcription, and outputs text to the currently focused window using keyboard simulation.

## Commands

### Running the Application (Updated August 30, 2025)
- `./launch_talkie.sh` - New unified launcher with automatic engine detection
- `python3 talkie.py` - Main application with OpenVINO Whisper integration
  - `--engine auto|vosk|openvino` - Force specific engine (default: auto)
  - `--whisper-model MODEL` - Specify OpenVINO Whisper model (default: openai/whisper-base)
  - `--ov-device AUTO|NPU|GPU|CPU` - OpenVINO device selection (default: AUTO)
- `./talkie.sh` - Shell wrapper with control commands (legacy):
  - `./talkie.sh start` - Start transcription
  - `./talkie.sh stop` - Stop transcription  
  - `./talkie.sh toggle` - Toggle transcription on/off
  - `./talkie.sh state` - Show current transcription state

### Dependencies
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (now includes OpenVINO packages)
- Uses Python virtual environment (pyvenv.cfg present)

### Validation Tools (New)
- `python3 verify_npu.py` - Check NPU and OpenVINO requirements
- `python3 test_engines.py` - Test available speech engines

### State Management
The application uses `~/.talkie` JSON file to track transcription state. The JSONFileMonitor.py watches for changes to this file to control the transcription process.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **talkie.py**: Main application with GUI (Tkinter) and speech processing
- **talkie-with-engine.py**: Alternative implementation with pluggable speech engines
- **JSONFileMonitor.py**: File watcher for state management
- **speech/**: Directory containing speech engine implementations

### Speech Engine Architecture (Updated August 30, 2025)
The project uses an adapter pattern for speech engines:
- **speech/speech_engine.py**: Base SpeechEngine abstract class and SpeechResult format (renamed from hyphenated file)
- **speech/Vosk_engine.py**: Vosk speech recognition implementation (renamed)
- **speech/FasterWhisper_engine.py**: FasterWhisper implementation (renamed)
- **speech/OpenVINO_Whisper_engine.py**: Intel OpenVINO Whisper implementation (renamed from VINOWisper.py)

### Key Architecture Changes (August 30, 2025)
- **Unified Engine Interface**: All speech engines now use the SpeechManager pattern
- **Automatic Engine Detection**: System automatically detects NPU availability and selects best engine
- **Python Naming Convention**: All files renamed from hyphens to underscores for proper Python imports
- **Enhanced CLI**: Command-line arguments for engine and model selection
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive testing and verification tools

### Key Features
- Multiple speech recognition backends (Vosk, Whisper variants)
- Real-time audio processing with configurable block duration (0.1s default)
- Number word-to-digit conversion using word2number
- Keyboard input simulation via uinput
- GUI with text preview and correction capabilities
- State-based processing (NORMAL/NUMBER modes)

### Configuration
- Default model path: `/home/john/Downloads/vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph`
- Audio block duration: 0.1 seconds
- Queue size: 5 blocks
- Uses 16kHz sample rate for audio processing

## Implementation Status (August 30, 2025)

### âœ… Completed:
1. File naming standardization (hyphens â†’ underscores)
2. OpenVINO Whisper integration framework
3. Automatic engine detection and fallback
4. Enhanced CLI with engine selection
5. NPU verification and testing tools
6. Updated dependencies and documentation

### âœ… Successfully Resolved (Session Continued):
