## The Streaming vs. Batch Divide

### Why Modern Models Struggle with Streaming

**Architectural Mismatch**:
- **Whisper/Transformer models**: Designed for complete context (30-second segments)
- **Real-time requirements**: Need processing of 0.1-second fragments
- **Context dependency**: Modern models rely on full sentence context for accuracy

**Technical Challenges**:
- **Chunking artifacts**: Breaking audio mid-word/sentence degrades accuracy
- **Latency requirements**: <200ms response time vs. 500ms+ model inference
- **Partial results**: Modern models output final text only, no incremental updates

### Successful Streaming Approaches

**Purpose-Built Architectures**:
- **Vosk/Kaldi**: Designed for incremental processing from ground up
- **Cloud services**: Custom streaming pipelines with specialized models
- **VAD integration**: Voice Activity Detection essential for streaming quality

**Hybrid Solutions**:
- **Voice Activity Detection** + **Batch processing** of speech segments
- **Buffering strategies**: 1-3 second windows with overlap
- **Result stabilization**: Partial result refinement over time

## Industry Trends (2024-2025)

### Convergence Attempts
- **WhisperLive**: Community effort to add streaming to Whisper (limited success)
- **whisper_streaming**: Academic approach with 3.3s latency (not true real-time)
- **RealtimeSTT**: Faster Whisper + VAD wrapper (inherits chunking issues)

### Enterprise Focus
- **Cloud-first**: Major vendors prioritizing cloud streaming services
- **Edge optimization**: Focus on efficient batch processing, not streaming
- **Model compression**: INT8/INT4 quantization for deployment efficiency

### Hardware Evolution
- **Specialized AI chips**: NPUs, AI accelerators becoming standard
- **Memory bandwidth**: Critical for large model inference
- **Power efficiency**: Edge deployment driving low-power AI development

## Conclusion

The ASR landscape in August 2025 reveals a persistent dichotomy: exceptional accuracy with batch processing versus practical real-time streaming capabilities. For applications requiring true real-time performance with partial results, **traditional streaming architectures like Vosk remain the most viable option** despite lower accuracy.

The promise of GPU/NPU acceleration for real-time streaming ASR remains largely unfulfilled, with available solutions focused on batch optimization rather than streaming architecture. This represents a significant opportunity for innovation in purpose-built streaming ASR acceleration.

**Key Insight**: The bottleneck is not computational power but architectural design - modern high-accuracy models are fundamentally incompatible with streaming requirements due to their dependence on complete contextual information.
