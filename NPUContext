Does Sherpa which is layered on top of Kaldi-K2 provide the proper level of API support for out application?

Sherpa, specifically Sherpa-onnx (which is built on top of Kaldi-K2), does indeed provide a higher-level API that could be more suitable for application-level integration compared to using Kaldi-K2 directly. Let's examine how Sherpa-onnx might fit your needs:

Advantages of using Sherpa-onnx:

1. Simplified API: Sherpa-onnx provides a more user-friendly API compared to raw Kaldi-K2, which could significantly reduce the complexity of integration.

2. ONNX Support: It uses ONNX runtime for inference, which can provide good performance and hardware compatibility.

3. Multiple Language Support: Sherpa-onnx supports various programming languages including C++, Python, Java, and C#, which offers flexibility in integration.

4. Pre-trained Models: It comes with pre-trained models, which can be a good starting point or baseline for your application.

5. Streaming Recognition: Supports real-time streaming recognition, which is crucial for many STT applications.

6. Cross-platform: Works on various platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

Considerations for your application:

1. API Compatibility: Sherpa-onnx's API is likely more aligned with application-level needs compared to raw Kaldi-K2. It provides methods for handling audio input, managing recognition sessions, and retrieving results.

2. Performance: While it should offer good performance, you'd need to benchmark it against your current Vosk-based solution to ensure it meets your requirements.

3. Customization: Check if Sherpa-onnx allows the level of customization you need. It might be more constrained compared to directly using Kaldi-K2.

4. Model Flexibility: Ensure that Sherpa-onnx supports the type of acoustic and language models you need for your application.

5. Integration Effort: While likely easier than raw Kaldi-K2, moving to Sherpa-onnx would still require significant changes to your codebase.

6. Community and Support: The Sherpa-onnx community is smaller than Kaldi's, which might impact the availability of resources and support.

To evaluate if Sherpa-onnx provides the proper level of API support for your application:

1. Review the Sherpa-onnx documentation and API reference to ensure it covers all the functionality you need.

2. Check if it supports the specific features you rely on in your current implementation (e.g., specific audio formats, real-time processing capabilities, any custom post-processing).

3. Create a small proof-of-concept implementation using Sherpa-onnx to process some sample audio and evaluate the results.

4. Test the latency and accuracy of Sherpa-onnx with your typical use cases and compare it to your current solution.

5. Evaluate how well Sherpa-onnx integrates with other components of your application (e.g., audio input handling, UI updates).

6. Consider any specific requirements you have for deployment, such as model size constraints or specific hardware optimizations.

Regarding the Intel NPU:

While Sherpa-onnx doesn't have explicit support for Intel's NPU, its use of ONNX runtime might provide a path to leverage this hardware:

1. Intel's OpenVINO toolkit supports ONNX models and can target NPUs.
2. You might be able to use OpenVINO to optimize the ONNX models used by Sherpa-onnx for Intel hardware, including NPUs.

In conclusion, Sherpa-onnx could provide a good balance between the low-level control of Kaldi-K2 and the higher-level API needed for application development. It might offer a smoother migration path compared to using Kaldi-K2 directly. However, you'll need to carefully evaluate its capabilities against your specific requirements to ensure it's the right fit for your application.
