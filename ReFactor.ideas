I've reviewed the provided code for the Talkie speech-to-text system. Here are some suggestions to improve the organization, refactor, and enhance the current design and implementation:

Modularization:
The code is already split into multiple files, which is good. However, we can further improve the organization by grouping related functionalities:

Create an audio module for audio-related functions (currently in audio_device.py).
Create a ui module for GUI-related code (currently in talkie.py).
Move transcription-related functions to a transcription module (currently spread across multiple files).


Configuration Management:
Instead of hardcoding configuration values, create a config.py file to store all configuration parameters. This will make it easier to manage and modify settings.
Type Hinting:
Add type hints to function parameters and return values. This will improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors early.
Error Handling:
Implement more robust error handling and logging throughout the application. This will make it easier to diagnose and fix issues.
Asynchronous Programming:
Consider using asyncio for handling concurrent operations, especially for audio processing and transcription. This could potentially improve performance and responsiveness.
Testing:
Implement unit tests for critical components of the application. This will help ensure reliability and make it easier to refactor in the future.
Documentation:
Add docstrings to classes and functions to improve code documentation. Consider using a tool like Sphinx to generate comprehensive documentation.
Code Style:
Ensure consistent code style throughout the project. Consider using a linter like flake8 and a formatter like black to maintain consistent coding standards.
Dependency Management:
Use a pyproject.toml file instead of requirements.txt for better dependency management. Consider using poetry for package management.
GUI Improvements:
Consider using a more modern GUI framework like PyQt or wxPython for a more robust and feature-rich user interface.
Refactoring Suggestions:

In transcription.py, consider using a class to encapsulate the transcription functionality instead of using global variables.
In text_processing.py, the process_text function is quite long. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions.
In talkie.py, separate the GUI creation and event handling into a dedicated class.


Performance Optimization:

Profile the application to identify potential bottlenecks, especially in audio processing and transcription.
